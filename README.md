Modify the Welcome component so that the Age component is rendered 5 times. For every time use conditional rendering with one of the following conditions:
- The Age component is rendered only if the age prop is greater than 18.
- The Age component is rendered only if the age prop is present.
- The Age component is rendered only if the age prop is greater than 18 and less than 65.
- The Age component is rendered only if the age prop is greater than 18, less than 65 and the name prop is equal to "John".
